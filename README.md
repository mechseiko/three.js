Three.js is a JavaScript library that allows developers to create 3D graphics in the browser using WebGL. It simplifies the process of rendering complex 3D scenes, making it easier to build interactive experiences, animations, and even games.

With Three.js, you can create scenes, cameras, meshes, and animations without needing deep knowledge of WebGL. Itâ€™s widely used for virtual reality, augmented reality, and web-based 3D applications.
